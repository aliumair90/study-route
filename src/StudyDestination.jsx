              Why Study in UK From Pakistan?
            </h1>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
              If you are a Pakistani student interested in studying abroad,
              there are many reasons to study abroad as part of your degree.
              Studying in the UK from Pakistan is possible either as a part of
              your course or as an overseas student through an exchange program,
              or we can help.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
              Moreover, you will develop a network of international contacts and
              gain broad knowledge and skills.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
              Pakistani university students can also benefit from the dual
              degree program that UK universities for Pakistani students are
              offering. The dual degree (also known as a double degree or dual
              award degree) allows you to earn two bachelor's degrees or two
              master's degrees in a shorter amount of time than it would take to
              complete each separately.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg mb-4">
              So these benefits encourage studying in the UK for Pakistani
              students; they will have an extra degree, and they could get a
              better job.
